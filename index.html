<h1> Thinking like a Programmer</h1>
<br> There are four main programming ways of thinking: procedural thinking, 
abstract thinking, systematic thinking, technological empathy
and last but not least systems thinking.
These notes are assigned to <em>technological empathy</em> which will help you to understand how the internet works.
<h2> <b> The basics of the web</b> </h2>
<br> The world wide web is a collection of <em>HTML </em>(Hyper Text Markup Language) files. 
HTML is a main type of a content which can be a plain text, images, music, videos etc.
Each HTML document is linked to another one, 
and they all together compose a web like it is.
<p> <b> Major pieces</b> </p>
How it works:
a user by means of computer runs a browser (EE/Chrome/Safari etc.),
which makes a request to servers through the Internet.
Servers are computers that host files that make up the web.
The Internet turns to servers using <em> http protocols</em> (the main protocol of the web)
and servers respond with files
which user's browser displays.
<h3><b>HTML</b></h3>
<br><em>HTML</em> documents are the heart of the web.
<br> HTML is made up of:
<br> 1. text content <em>(what you see)</em>
<br> 2. markup <em>(what it looks like)</em>
<br> 3. references to other documents <em>(images, videos etc.)</em>
<br> 4. links to other pages
<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=43&v=5Kjx-NOwcSc">This video</a> explains HTML basics.
<p><b>TAGS</b></p>
<br> HTML markup is made up of tags: <em> 'Opening tag' (in angle brackets) Content '/Closing tag' (in angle brackets). </em>
Most of HTML tags come in pairs, but some of them are unpaired and called <em>void</em> (they don't have a content, so they don't need a closing tag, for example,'img' and 'br').
<p><b>ELEMENTS</b></p>
<br> An <em>HTML element</em> refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.
<p><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></p>
<br> HTML elements can have <em>attributes</em>. Attributes always follow an openning tag.
They look like: <em>attribute name="value"</em>.
<p><b>INLINE/BLOCK TAGS</b></p>
<br>There are <em>inline and block tags</em>.
<em>Inline</em> tags just end a line, and <em>block</em> tags make an ivisible box around the content.
Block tags have height and width.
The other one example of inline/block tags: 'span' is inline and 'div' is block.
